 BOSSFIGHT:

 For demonstration purposes, we have set it so you encounter the skeleton king after you reach level 3. If you beat him you will win the game, if you die you lose and the game closes.

 In an actual playthrough we intend for the boss to be fought at level 5. If you wish to fight him as intended just change the level check threshold in the returnOpponent() function in Monster.cpp to 5.

 Enjoy the game!
