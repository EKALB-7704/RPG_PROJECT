This text file is for writing new features to add, ideas to be developed, and general improvents to the game.


Add an idea if you think of something and number it.

List is in no particular order and no task has inherent priority over another,
BUT if you feel a specific task is important to be finished quickly you can mark it with [IMPORTANT].

If you undertake a task, mark your [NAME] beside the corrosponding entry to prevent duplicate development.
Test code to the best of your ability, and ensure project builds and runs before commiting.

IF and only IF, your code does not compile due to an issue with vscode (which is likely) 
rather than the code itself, then just state that in your commit message so everyone is aware.

When a task is done/in progress mark it with [DONE]/[IN PROGRESS], Display Gold task is included as an example.
